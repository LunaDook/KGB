Alright, this is a long list and "Special thanks to a lot of people" isn't gonna cut it.

I'll organize it in three categories: people who contributed code (knowingly or unknowingly), people who answered my questions and people who helped me test.

# Code

Gelex for creating libctr9_io and finally being able to release it :D.

mid-kid for CakesFW, because my decryption code is "heavily inspired" (read: total ripoff) on his'. If you're interested in this stuff, you should check it out.

dark-samus for his arm9loaderhax fork, specifically his stage2, which I also use (with modifications). This also includes delebile, b1l1s, etc.

AuroraWright for the great idea of using memory searching functions in order to patch firmwares instead of using fixed offsets (and, you know, providing them).

yifanlu for his 3ds_injector, which I also use to provide RF patches and such.

# Answers

Well, this is a pretty short list:

d0k3 for answering my questions related to FIRM0 decryption (sorry it didn't work out :( ).

3dbrew.org and its authors.

# Testers

Al3x_10m for being the best one at this :3. Also for testing both on O3DS and N3DS (and it's hideous uSD card slot).

Lucar for being insane enough to test FIRM protection without a hardmod and overall help.

imanoob for testing early versions on O3DS

Nintendohacks for being helpful from time to time :P


And everyone else who I might forget about.
